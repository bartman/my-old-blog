So, did you hear?  <a href=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/822>Carcassonne</a> was invaded by <a href=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/2471>Zombies!</a>
</p>

<p>
My group of <a href=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/>board game geeks</a> have been playing <i>Carcassonne</i> for a while, and recently have started playing <i>Zombies!</i>.  Jean, aka <i>Strogg</i>, and I have brainstormed how <i>Zombies!</i> could work in <i>Carcassonne</i>.  See that <a href=http://pastebin.com/527575>here</a>.
</p>

<p>
In a bit more detail, here are the rule changes to <i>Carcassonne</i>:
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li><a href=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/15158>the dragon</a> is removed from the game.  it is replaced by a <a href=http://www.thegameshop.ca/bagozombies.html>bag of zombies</a>;
    <li>each time a volcano is placed it is occupied by a new zombie;
    <li>when a dragon tile comes out, starting with the player that placed the dragon tile, players in clock-wise order move 1 zombie each until 6 movements were made (a zombie can be moved multiple times);
    <li>when a zombie enters a tile with a follower, the follower is returned to the player and a new zombie is added on that tile; while the zombie that infected the meeple can move again, the new zombie will not move until next turn;
    <li>zombies may not enter a tile with a fairy, any tile surrounding a cloister, the city of Carcassonne, or a tile visited/occupied by a zombie this turn;
    <li>if at the end of any turn, there are more zombies then followers in any city or on any road, all followers in that feature are returned to their owner (they flee!); note that <i>deeple</i> (double meeple) count as two as usual and builders count as one;
    <li>if a road or city is completed with a zombie on it, that city is worth one less point for each zombie; this road or city also does not cause an exchange of the thief or king card;
    <li>zombies also reduce the points scored on a farm, but for each zombie on a farm the player scores one less city;
    <li>a player that scores on a cloister may elect to remove any zombie from the board, up to 8, at the cost of a point being scored by the cloister; this can also be done at the end, with uncompleted cloisters, for helping farmers; except for the end game, the last zombie may not be removed in this way;
    <li>a player can chose to return an monk on an unfinished cloister, and return a zombie to the bag; this can be done at any time, even before scoring occurs on another player's turn;
  </ol>

We have not played it yet... so I don't know how good the mod is.
