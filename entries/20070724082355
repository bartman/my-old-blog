I was recently talking to [Jean](http://geemoo.ca/) about lowering power consumption.  One of
the things I do is to purge all modules when I go to battery power.  Here is the script I 
use to remove unwanted modules.

        lsmod | awk '/0 *$/ {print $1}' | xargs -n1 sudo rmmod

Building things as modules makes this more successful.  And you have to run it a few times to 
get all the unused modules out.  Maybe something like this would work...

        while lsmod | grep -q '0 *$' ; do
                lsmod | awk '/0 *$/ {print $1}' | xargs -n1 sudo rmmod
        done
