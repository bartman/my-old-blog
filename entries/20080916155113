As awesome as `git-svn` is, I had it fail today with this message:

        Last fetched revision of refs/remotes/branches/foo was r19307, but we are about to fetch: r19307!

To which I said: "WTF?".  I still don't know what it means, but I can share with you how I recovered it.

It turns out that git-svn is quite capable of recovering from this.  You just have to remove it's meta data
for the offending branch, and resync with SVN.

        rm -f .git/svn/branches/foo/.rev_*
        git svn fetch

I actually had multiple branches in this bad state -- but not all of them -- and I had to repeat it for
all those that it complained about.
