Jen gave birth to our baby boy at 1:09 PM April 19th, 2006.  Adam was born
weighing 8 lb 13 oz (4 kg) and is 22 in (55 cm) long.  It was an
unexpectedly quick delivery, which was most welcomed by the mom.

After spending just over a day at the Civic Hospital, we returned home
and are getting to know our Adam.  [Adam's gallery page](http://gallery.jukie.net/adam)
is where you will find some of the first few pictures of Adam... there will be many more to come.
As you can see Kelly is thrilled of her new role as the big sister.
