Someone on `#oclug` was asking about building C programs with make.  I wrote up this *simple* Makefile for him.

Note that you have to set `TARGET` with your executable name, and list the .c files to compile in `SRCS`.  Also,
note that Makefile indents must be **tabs**, not spaces.

        TARGET  := <<your executable name>> 
        SRCS    := <<one ore more of your .c files>> 
        OBJS    := ${SRCS:.c=.o} 
        DEPS    := ${SRCS:.c=.dep} 
        XDEPS   := $(wildcard ${DEPS}) 
         
        CCFLAGS = -std=gnu99 -O2 -Wall -Werror -ggdb 
        LDFLAGS = 
        LIBS    = 
         
        .PHONY: all clean distclean 
        all:: ${TARGET} 
         
        ifneq (${XDEPS},) 
        include ${XDEPS} 
        endif 
         
        ${TARGET}: ${OBJS} 
            ${CC} ${LDFLAGS} -o $@ $^ ${LIBS} 
         
        ${OBJS}: %.o: %.c %.dep 
            ${CC} ${CCFLAGS} -o $@ -c $< 
         
        ${DEPS}: %.dep: %.c Makefile 
            ${CC} ${CCFLAGS} -MM $< > $@ 
         
        clean:: 
           -rm -f *~ *.o ${TARGET} 
         
        distclean:: clean
