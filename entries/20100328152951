I got a SIM card from WIND on Friday, [the opening day]{nexus-on-wind-in-ottawa}, and all of a sudden everyone I know
wants me to drop by their house to test the service there.  Guys, it's only $15 for a month of testing... :D

So far in my neighbourhood (Central Park), and the immediate surroundings I get 3-4 bars (out of 4).  Clearly I am well covered.

The family and I were going out of town on Saturday, so I asked my lovely wife to note the changes in the
signal as we drove west out of Ottawa on the 417.  Here is what she wrote down:

<blockquote><i>
Along 417 signal dropped to two bars outside of Bayshore briefly before returning to four bars when approaching Kanata.
Two bars noted again at Scotiabank Place, with zero bars quickly after.  At stittsville exit service switched to roaming
(Rogers GSM network) at four bars, which quickly fell to no signal.
</i></blockquote>

Ok, so there you have it.  If you live past the hockey arena, you're not likely to like WIND.
