I am leaving my employer of two years, <a href=http://somanetworks.com>SOMA 
Networks</a>, for new opportunities at <a href=http://fortinet.com>Fortinet</a>.
I have a lot of mixed feelings, but I recall feeling this way when I left my 
last job.

Fortinet Technologies has recently been features in an Ottawa Citizen <a href=http://www.canada.com/ottawa/ottawacitizen/news/business/story.html?id=0b98fffd-1678-4479-b051-63e12c3f960f>article</a>.  Seems like a big change to work for a company with <u>real</u> clients and <u>real</u> products. :)
