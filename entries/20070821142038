Someone on the [#oclug](http://oclug.on.ca) channel said today:

  *Mind you, and vim-keybindings add-on for OOo would be nice.*

So I did the natural thing I googled for it.  I am already using vi-bindings
in firefox (vimperator) and in zsh.

I came accords a link on [using vi shortcuts in abiword](http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Apps/abiword-vi-mode.html), which
was instantly interesting to me.  I tried the procedure and it didn't work.  However,
making the following change did work...

And now I have modal editing support in an office suite.  I still have to play with it to see if
I find it useful... but initially it looks great.
