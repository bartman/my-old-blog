Subject: tiding up the PATH

I have previously noticed that loading up the list of application available in `$PATH` took a long
time in [wmii-lua]{tag/wmiirc-lua}.  I recently found out that it was related to me having multiple
duplicates in my [zsh]{tag/zsh} environment.

To clean this up I [added the following](http://www.jukie.net/~bart/conf/zsh.d/S99_tidy) to my
zsh configuration:

        typeset -U path cdpath manpath fpath

This removes duplicates from the `PATH`, `CDPATH`, `MANPATH`, and `FPATH` variables.

Zsh rocks!
