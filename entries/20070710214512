Subject: git-clean in svn land

Some things are easier in [git]{tag/git}.  For example to nuke all changes and only keep files that are
tracked by git I would run:

        git-clean -d -x
        git-checkout -f

In [svn]{tag/svn} it's a bit more involved, but not impossible:

        svn status --no-ignore | awk '{print $2}' | xargs rm -rf
        svn revert -R .
        svn update

For extra *fun*... the `svn revert -R` will actually stop on any symlinks to directories.  Fun!
