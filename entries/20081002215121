A kind [wmiirc-lua]{tag/wmiirc-lua} user, Sytse Wielinga (sytse on irc), had
debugged an old issue in luaixp code I had written for wmiirc-lua.

While this bug directly addresses *raw mode* (Mod4-space), I belive that this will fix
a bunch of weird issues so I released v0.2.5.  Since v0.2.4 there was also a small
bug in the battery plugin that was fixed.

*What is it?*

Wmiirc-lua is an event loop manager for the [wmii](http://www.suckless.org/wiki/wmii)
tiling window manager.  As the name suggests it's written in Lua, and strives to
have a low system overhead.

*How to get it?*

The easiest way to get wmiirc-lua and its dependencies is to grab the 
[kitchen sink]{wmiirc-lua-kitchen-sink} repository.

If you prefer to get the bits yourself, here is the list of repositories you
will need to build:

  * libixp: `git://tachyon.jukie.net/libixp.git/`
  * wmii: `git://tachyon.jukie.net/wmii.git/`
  * wmiirc-lua: `git://tachyon.jukie.net/wmiirc-lua.git/`
  * dmenu: `git://tachyon.jukie.net/dmenu.git/`
  * slock: `git://tachyon.jukie.net/slock.git/`

*Changes since v0.2.4*

  * fix bug in ixp.read() code and ixp.iread() (Sytse Wielinga)
  * fixed a resource leak in battery plugin (Bart Trojanowski)

Also the [kitchen sink]{wmiirc-lua-kitchen-sink} repository and submodules have been updated
to the most recent *wmii* and *libixp* with some fixes of their own.
