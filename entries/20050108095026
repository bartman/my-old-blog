Wasted some time this week converting my server to LDAP directories and
renumbering UIDs/GIDs to the "Debian numbering ranges" from the RedHat
ranges that I have lived with for 7 years -- I have a lot of data to
migrate over to the new IDs... data is intact.

LDAP is so ugly after you used SQL, and is a bitch to setup, but after a
few hours I managed to get it working with PAM and NSS.  I will have to
document my steps because I had to read ~10 documents on the web to
finally get things working -- the Debian packages do not do all the work
for you in this case. 

I still don't have my desktops setup the way I want, but the vservers
can feed from LDAP for user IDs (for ssh logins and lookup when you do
things like ls -l or id).  And there is always the issue of what is to
be done with the mobile machine...  I think I will just use ssh-fs 
(via fuse) and not worry about having a common .

Stay tuned for further details :)
