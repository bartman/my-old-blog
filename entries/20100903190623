I've finally gotten onto the IPv6 bandwagon and went through the process of converting my network to IPv6.  Ya know, 
[the end](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion) [is near](http://ipv6.he.net/statistics/).

I am using an [he.net](http://he.net) tunnel, and am almost done going through their [certification process](http://ipv6.he.net/certification).

##Update

Apparently there is a huge shortage of Canadian registrars that can provide full ipv6 support.  The only one
I was able to find is [BareMeta.com](http://baremetal.ca/), which despite it's TLD operates out of 
Victoria, BC.  I haven't switched yet, because while they support ipv6 glue records for *.ca*, they don't
for *.net* yet).
