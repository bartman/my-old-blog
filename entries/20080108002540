I ran into a strange NFS + KVM issue.  Every so often under heavy NFS load my KVM client
would hang retrying the nfs server.  On the console the client was showing:

        nfs: server host not responding, still trying

I found [this bug post](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=893831&aid=1771262&group_id=180599)
which does not seem to have been resolved in 2.6.24.

Using the kvm flag `-net nic,model=rtl8139` fixed the problem for me.
