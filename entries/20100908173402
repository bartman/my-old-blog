Apparently there is a huge shortage of Canadian registrars that can provide full ipv6 support.  The only one
I was able to find is [BareMeta.com](http://baremetal.ca/), which despite it's TLD operates out of 
Victoria, BC.  I haven't switched yet, because while they support ipv6 glue records for *.ca*, they don't
for *.net* yet.

Here is the discussion on dslreports.com where it [was mentioned](http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r24181473-TekSavvy-DNS-servers-and-IPv6?r=0.730862192615074).
