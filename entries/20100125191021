I just received the following text from Rogers, and as it claims my data
access has been disabled.  Since I am running [CyanogenMod](http://www.cyanogenmod.com/)
I never had the 911 issues that the stock Rogrers firmware experienced.

        Rogers/Fido Safety Message: URGENT Reminder 911 Calls HTC Dream
        software update: Mandatory software update is now available to help
        ensure 911 calls are completed from your phone. Please go immediately

        In order to help ensure 911 calls are completed internet access was

        We apologize for the inconvenience but we prioritize customer safety

So I called rogers to get it straightened out and get my data access back.
However since everyone in the country that has a Dream or Magic got 
their service cut... you can imagine I wasn't the first one to call and
complain.  When the automated system told me that I would have to wait for 30
minutes I hung up.  My time is a bit more important than that.

Well, this is one more strike for Rogers, and one more reason to leave.  Let's
hope [WIND](http://www.windmobile.ca/) is all that it's cracked up to be.

*UPDATE*: looks like there is some [good news](http://www.androidincanada.ca/news/rogers-begins-pushing-out-android-rom-update-for-htc-magicdream/#comment-31091533):
if you call and tell them you are running Linux, they'll "refresh your phone".  But you 
should [avoid using the upgrade](http://www.androidincanada.ca/news/rogers-begins-pushing-out-android-rom-update-for-htc-magicdream/#comment-31334960)
as it will mean the end of your root... at least for now.

*UPDATE 2*: called rogers support and spoke with 4 drones.  Two were not informative.  Then, I was told that
there was no block out on my data plan...  that was encouraging, enve though my phone still had no data
access.  I was then transfered to someone that was a bit more clueful, but they told me that the network
will not enable my account until my firmware is the right version.  He insisted that enabling my account
was not possilbe from their end.

<b>Bull!</b>

I think I have 3 choices.

 - leave Rogers.  which I still am likely to do when WIND starts to operate in Ottawa.

 - borrow someone's phone for a day to fool the system into thinking I have updated.

 - call "Rogers customer retentions", which I've been told can do anything to keep me as a customer.
