I put my camera SD/HC card into my laptop (running Debian/testing) and it
didn't mount.  Usually I would just run the `mount` command to get it going:

        dmesg | tail
        mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt

That unfortunately has some annoyances and I decided to solve this finally.

First I installed usbmount:

        apt-get install usbmount

This is just a simple package that allows you to control how attachable
devices are mounted on your system.  You can control UID/GID ownership,
filesystem flags, etc.

Next I edited the `/lib/udev/rules.d/usbmount.rules` config file, adding the
following two lines at the bottom of the file:

        KERNEL=="mmcblk*", DRIVERS=="mmc_block", ACTION=="add",    RUN+="/usr/share/usbmount/usbmount add"
        KERNEL=="mmcblk*", SUBSYSTEMS=="mmc",    ACTION=="add",    RUN+="/usr/share/usbmount/usbmount add"
        KERNEL=="mmcblk*",                       ACTION=="remove", RUN+="/usr/share/usbmount/usbmount remove" 


And then I inserted my SD/HC card, and my `/dev/mmcblk0p1` was automatically
mounted under `/media/usb0`.
