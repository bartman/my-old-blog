I've previously written about [how to root an android phone]{rooting-g1}, and mentioned that [there was a better way](http://androidandme.com/2009/08/news/root-a-t-mobile-mytouch-3g-or-g1-in-6-minutes-and-flash-cyanogens-rom-with-donut-crumbs/)
which I had not tried yet.  Well, I did try it today.

The procedure written by [Zinx](http://zenthought.org/content/project/flashrec) from [ZenThought](http://zenthought.org/) exploits a recently found bug in the Linux kernel (see [CVE-2009-2692](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2009-2692)).

<read-more>

The exploit code is a fun read and I encourage the geeks to go and get [flashrec-20090815.tar.gz](http://zenthought.org/system/files/asset/2/flashrec-20090815.tar.gz) and read it.

For the rest of you, here are the steps to use it:

 - on a freshly network-unlocked Tmobile G1...
 - point your browser at [flashrec-20090815.apk](http://zenthought.org/system/files/asset/2/flashrec-20090815.apk), or a shorter version of the url [http://2tu.us/oqk](http://2tu.us/oqk)
 - follow the procedure to allow untrusted package sources
 - run the app
 - backup your current recovery image
 - install the new CM 1.4 recovery image
 - <b>power off</b> the phone (rebooting it doesn't do it)
 - power on holding the home key

... and now you can install any rom you want.

To install the latest CyanogenMod, you'll need to download these files:

 - [ota-radio-2_22_19_26I.zip](http://android-roms.googlecode.com/files/ota-radio-2_22_19_26I.zip)
 - [update-cm-4.0.2-signed.zip](http://n0rp.chemlab.org/android/update-cm-4.0.2-signed.zip)

copy both to the SD card.  If you have the [Android Debug Bridge](http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/adb.html) (or `adb`) working
you can just run:

    # adb push ota-radio-2_22_19_26I.zip /sdcard/ota-radio-2_22_19_26I.zip
    # adb push update-cm-4.0.2-signed.zip /sdcard/update-cm-4.0.2-signed.zip

From the `Android system recovery` screen (power up with `HOME` key held).

*(note, you can use the rolly-ball to manuver the menu and push the ball to select options)*

 - select `Alt-A` or `apply any zip from sd`
 - select `ota-radio-2_22_19_26I.zip`
   
   ... wait ...

 - select `Alt-A` or `apply any zip from sd`
 - select `update-cm-4.0.2-signed.zip`
   
   ... wait ...

 - reboot with `HOME` + `BACK` keys.
   
   ... wait ...

 - select `Alt-W` or `wipe data/factory reset`
 - reboot with `HOME` + `BACK` keys.
   
   ... wait a long time ...
   
   ... now, wait some more ...

On the first boot (and it will reboot several times) it will take under 5 minutes.  Be patient.
Durring this first long boot the phone is initializing the apps.
