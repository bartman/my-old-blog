This will show you the IP addresses that have failed to login as well 
as the number of attempts that failed.  

grep 'Failed password ' /var/log/auth.log | sed 's/^.* \([0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\) .*$/\1/' | sort  | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10

You can safely ignore a few failed attempts, but I was getting close to 
3000 over the last week from one IP.  I decided that warranted some 
action. :)

I will probably grow this to a script that will automatically generate
and maintain a "evil IP list" in iptables.  For now you can take the top
offenders and drop them into a -j DROP rule.
