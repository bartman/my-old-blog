Subject: Perl, Catalyst, CPAN, and Debian

<p>I've decided to give <a href=http://catalyst.perl.org/>Catalyst</a> a try.  I am not a big web-head, but occasionally I want to put stuff up on my site... and would like most of the work to be done for me, but not so much of the work that I cannot control what is happening.  I was not ready for a new scripting language so Ruby on Rails and Turbo Gears were out.</p>

<p>Catalyst is available from CPAN -- the real reason why anyone would be crazy enough to use perl.  But running CPAN stuff on Debian is a pain in the ass, more so then Debian taught me is an acceptable level of ass pain, because perl stuff in Debian tends to lag behind CPAN; even in testing.</p>

<p>Today, while testing the hypothesis that everything that is cool has already been done, I came across this: <a href=http://alibi.simon-cozens.org/~simon/cpan2deb>cpan2deb</a>.  It claims to do what the name would suggest -- it creates deb's from cpan distributed perl modules.  Very cool.  I will have to build up Catalyst this way.</p>

<p>Now... where did I leave that spare time I had.  It's here somewhere.</p>
