I have had an item on my todo list to improve my vim/git integration for a while.  Today,
I found [git-vim](http://github.com/motemen/git-vim/tree/master) on github.  I was really
impressed.  So I forked it and hope to do some work on the project...

        git://git.jukie.net/git-vim.git

First I will have to check if there is anything salvageable from [my current vim scripts](http://www.vim.org/account/profile.php?user_id=1186).
