I wrote a [short script](/~bart/scripts//shorturl/shorturl) to shrink URLs:

        % shorturl http://www.jukie.net/~bart/shorturl
        http://2tu.us/ce8

        % shorturl
        Type in some urls and I'll try to shrink them for you...

        http://www.jukie.net/~bart/20090320214228
        http://2tu.us/ce9

I am doing this as part of my new [identi.ca](http://identi.ca/barttrojanowski) addiction`^W`
usage and extending GregKH's [command line micro blogging tool](http://github.com/bartman/bti/commits/master).

*UPDATE:* also picked up by [@vando for use with mcabber](http://identi.ca/notice/21908233).
