What a busy week!

As the dust of the (extremely) well attended Ottawa IPv6 Summit settles, we are
working through some post conference tasks.

I've just updated the presentation page on the site to include the slide decks
of most of the presentations. I am still waiting for files from few speakers.
You view the ones which are available on [the presentation page](http://ipv6summit.ca/index.php/v6/2011/schedConf/presentations).

As you may have noticed -- if you were lucky to get in before we sold out --
the talks were recorded. The results of the recordings will go up on our
website within a few weeks.
