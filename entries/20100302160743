I had been unpleasantly informed by mdadm that *sdc* has been failing.  *Yey, another one* -- I thought.
Not wanting to disrupt most of my day, I decided to try hot swapping the disk.

I [learned on the interweb](http://linux.derkeiler.com/Newsgroups/comp.os.linux.hardware/2006-11/msg00122.html)
about the *scsiadd* utility and installed it:

    apt-get install scsiadd

I then had to discover what *sdc* was on my system.  Fortunately `/sys` had that information:

    ls /sys/bus/scsi/devices/*\:0\:0\:0/block:* -d    

After discovering that `2:0:0:0` was really the same as *sdc* on my system, I took the drive off line:

    scsiadd -r 2 0 0 0

I then swapped the disk for a new one, and added it back in:

    scsiadd -a 2 0 0 0

NOTE: at this point I got a *sdf*, not a *sdc* as I would expect.

Next came the boring steps of `fdisk`ing the new disk, and running

    mdadm --add /dev/md0 /dev/sdf1

... to add it back to the array.
