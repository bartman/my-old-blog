In the summer of 2010 a half dozen [OCLUG](http://oclug.on.ca) members decided it would be a good idea
to put on an IPv6 conference for Ottawa.  I was one of those people!

At the time IANA still had lots of IPv4 addresses, but it was projected to run out in May of 2011.
It seemed that no one in Canada was doing anything about it, and people needed to be educated.

And so, the [IPv6summit.ca](http://ipv6summit.ca) was born.

Here is the official description from our webiste...

<blockquote><i>
This event targets hands-on IT managers, of both business and government
divisions, semi-pro hobbyists, and computer enthusiasts alike.  We want to
reach the people who do the work, and the people who make the decision as to
when. Naturally, our audience will want to know why, but our focus is on how,
and when.
</i></blockquote>

We knew that managers didn't like talks about packets, and developers didn't
want to hear about the fiscal plan.  To prevent people from falling asleep we
split the conference into a couple of streams:

 - Technical: come here if you like packets and config files,
 - Management/Business: come here if you don't.
 - Demos/Tutorials: come here if you want to show things off.

Around December we were graciously offered to use the new [Telfer](http://www.telfer.uottawa.ca)
facilities ([The Desmarais Building](http://www.telfer.uottawa.ca/en/the-desmarais-building))
at the University of Ottawa.

We still have a few spots for speakers, and our 
[Call For Presentations](http://ipv6summit.ca/index.php/v6/2011/schedConf/cfp) is open.  If you
know anyone that you'd like to hear speak about IPv6 [let us know](mailto:info@ipv6summit.ca).

The final speaker list is not yet public, but we have talks being given by some very 
prominent figures from important Internet agencies (ARIN, CIRA, HE.net, and more).

Registration will likely open this week.  Please stay tunned.

In the meantime you can sign up for updates on our media sites...
