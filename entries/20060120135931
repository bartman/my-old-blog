<p>Martin, Harper and Layton are flying on the Executive Airbus to a gathering 
in British Columbia when Martin turns to Harper and says, chuckling, "<i>You 
know, I could throw a $1000 bill out the window right now and make someone 
very happy.</i>" 
</p>
 
<p> Harper shrugs and replies, "<i>Well, I could throw ten $100 bills out the 
window and make ten people happy.</i>" 
</p>
 
<p>Not to be outdone, Layton says, "<i>Well I could throw a hundred $10 bills out 
the window and make a hundred people happy.</i>" 
</p>
 
<p>The pilot rolls his eyes and says to his co-pilot, "<i>Such arrogant asses 
back there. Hell, I could throw all three of them out the window and make 
32 million people happy.</i>"
