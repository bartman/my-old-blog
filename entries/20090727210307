I am a late comer to the Android craze.  I got to play with one recently at the [Linux Symposium](http://linuxsymposium.org)
in Montreal, and I decided I have to get one.  I ended up picking up a pair from ebay -- one to hack on, and one to carry
in my pocket.

I'd like to work on the core platform and not so much the apps.

Anyway, my storey is boring so far.

Below are the interesting links I found so far while researching the platform.

### Names.

Note that the device I am talking about here is the [T-Mobile G1](http://www.t-mobileg1.com),
known to some as the [Android Dev Phone 1](http://android.brightstarcorp.com/), to others as the
[HTC Dream](http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_dream-2665.php), or just as *Google Phone*.

I'll just call it the G1... because it's short.

### Hardware.

First let's start with the guts.  It was amazingly hard to find the
[hardware block diagram](http://www.phonewreck.com/images/t-mobile_g1_block_diagram.jpg)
for the G1.


 * Specification
   * [HTC Dream product specs](http://www.htc.com/www/product/dream/specification.html) - Platform info from the horse's mouth.

 * Architecture
   * phoneWreck's [T-Mobile G1 â€“ Review and Teardown](http://www.phonewreck.com/2008/12/09/t-mobile-g1-review-and-teardown/) - 
     This is where the block diagram came from.  They also ripped the phone apart to show all the components.
   * techonline's [Under the Hood: Android dreams, GooglePhone delivers](http://www.techonline.com/product/underthehood/211600819?pgno=1) -
     Similar article, briefly covers the major hardware components.


 * CPU/chipset
   
   The heart of the G1 is an ARM11 based RISC processor from Qualcomm -- wrapped into a MSM7201A chipset.
   Note that the ARM family is ARM11, but the architecture version is 
   ARMv6 (see [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture#ARM_cores)).
   
   I have yet to be able to find any low level information on the MSM7201A.  The official page on the 
   [MSM7201A Chipset Solution](http://www.qctconnect.com/products/msm_7201.html) from Qualcomm is rather shallow.
   
   [Dave Sparks](http://www.mail-archive.com/android-developers@googlegroups.com/msg33476.html) was seen saying:
   
     *Chipset vendors consider that information a trade secret and only
     release it to high-volume customers that have signed non-disclosure
     agreements.*
   
   Anyway, here is what I found:
   
   * PDAdb.net's [MSM7201A Chipset simplified technical specifications](http://pdadb.net/index.php?m=cpu&id=a7201a&c=qualcomm_msm7201a)
   * htc-linux's [Kernel for MSM7xxxA based devices](http://htc-linux.org/wiki/index.php?title=Kernel)
   * ARM's [instruction set](http://www.arm.com/products/CPUs/architecture.html) page
     * ARM's [ARMv6 architecture](http://www.arm.com/pdfs/ARMv6_Architecture.pdf) document
     * [ARM1136J(F)-S technical reference manual](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0211k/index.html)

 * Emulator
   * official [Android emulator](http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/emulator.html) page
   * [T-Mobile G1 Emulator powered by Modea](http://tmobile.modeaondemand.com/htc/g1/) presentation
   * [Google Android Emulator Tutorial](http://www.android.encke.net/android-emulator-tutorial.html)
   * [Sensor Simulator](http://code.google.com/p/openintents/wiki/SensorSimulator)
