I will be kicking off a new series of talks at [OCLUG](http://oclug.on.ca/) later this month.  The
idea is not mine, but a copy of a [similar series](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22Kernel+Walkthrough%22&search_type=&aq=f)
ran by [Silicon Valley Linux Users Group](http://www.svlug.org/).  Kudos to them!

Here is the info on the first [Kernel Walkthrough: Source Tree Layout](http://oclug.on.ca/meeting/32/).
I will start off by covering the tree structure and talk a bit about the components, before handing 
control of the talk over to the audience and let them drive the types of things they would like to
explore.

We are being hosted by the [TheCodeFactory](http://thecodefactory.ca/), which is a very cool
concept.  From the website:

> "TheCodeFactory is a collaborative work space located in downtown Ottawa at 246
> Queen Street, between Bank and Kent, above the Green Papaya Restaurant. 
> TheCodeFactory is a clubhouse or water cooler for the Start-up community in Ottawa."

In short they are a place where startups can meet and collaborate way before they have
any office space of their own.  Ottawa being such a hotspot for startups, this is clearly
a good idea.
