I just discovered a [git]{tag/git} feature that has eluded me since v1.4.3, when it was
introduced.  It's a way to colour differing words in `git diff` output.  Maybe you don't
know about it either... allow me demonstrate:

Let's initialize a simple tree:

        # git init
        # echo some existing text > file
        # git add file
        # git commit -m"some commit" file
        # echo some changed text and some new > file

So now we have a tree with a file that contains one word altered.

Here is a comparison of `git-diff` with and without the `--color-words` option:
