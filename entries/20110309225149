Long time no blog... I've been realy busy getting the [Ottawa IPv6 Summit](http://ipv6summit.ca) off the
ground (along with [several other people](http://ipv6summit.ca/index.php/v6/2011/about/organizingTeam)
from [OCLUG](http://oclug.on.ca)).  I'll have to blog about that soon.

Anyway... I've also been learning a lot more about IPv6.  Which reminded me that I never
finished my [IPv6 Certification](http://ipv6.he.net/certification/cert-main.php) from
[Hurricane Electric](http://he.net/).  I stopped at the <i>Guri</i> level because getting
<i>Sage</i> (the top level) meant that I would have had to have a 
[sane domain name registrar](http://www.jukie.net/~bart/blog/20100908173402).

I actually registered *ipv6summit.ca* with [BareMetal.com](http://BareMetal.com), and so I already
had an [IPv6 Glue record](http://www.sixxs.net/faq/dns/?faq=ipv6glue) for this domain.

        # whois ipv6summit.ca
        Domain name:           ipv6summit.ca
        ...
        Name servers:
            ns.ipv6summit.ca       70.38.99.170       2001:470:1c:1cb::6:0

Anyway, long story short... I am now a *Sage*!
