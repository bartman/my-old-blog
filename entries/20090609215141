I came across a cool post on the [kvm blog](http://www.linux-kvm.com/content/libguestfs-management-guest-images) today
about [libguestfs](http://libguestfs.org/) and it's [various uses](http://libguestfs.org/recipes.html) that I wanted to
share.  If you are using virtualization and have images sitting around, this is a great tool to create, inspect, and modify
them... should you have the need.
