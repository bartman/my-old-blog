I sold my 3 month old Canon "Digital Rebel" 300D.  Upgraded to a Nikon 
D70...  and what a huge difference that was.  
</p>
<p>
I do find the pictures that are produced with the D70 sensor not as high
in detail under some conditions, however I must say that overall they are
at par.  The &quot;big difference&quot; comes in the rest of the camera.
</p>
<p>
The interface makes it far quicker to access control options and the
camera itself is faster to react -- no more missing shots because my
daughter wont sit still -- and I can just shoot freely without checking
if the memory buffer is full (my Rebel sometimes became unoperational 
when it was saving data to compact flash).
</p>
<p>
On the negative, the D70 has a small issue referred to as &quot;back
focusing&quot;, which I have seen a few times.  The camera has a hard time
deciding what to focus on if there is a large flat background behind a 
small subject.  Taking a second image with AF, or just using manual focusing, 
fixes the problem for me... I guess I will live until they fix it in firmware.
