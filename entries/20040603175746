<p>I've been taking digital images for over a year (maybe), but using Gimp for
many years for just about any image manipulation.  It's a fantastic program...
possibly the best piece of (desktop) software on Linux.

<a href=http://www.linuxartist.org/2d.php>2d application list</a><br>
which has a list of several other nice image related software packages.
