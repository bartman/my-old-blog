I just switched to the *Holiday Miracle Plan* from
[WindMobile.ca](http://windmobile.ca).  I thought I'd mention it since it's not
advertised, but a fantastic deal.  You have to sign up by December 26th, but you get
to keep this rate for as long as you are a customer.

In short: it's unlimited-everything for $40/month.  It's Wind, so there are no contracts, hidden fees, or strings attached.
