First let me explain the terminology.  There are two ways in which the HTC Dream (aka Tmobile G1) can be unlocked:

 - so called *rooting*, which I describe in this post, involves replacing the bootloader so that the phone can use
   community generated firmware images, aka *ROM*'s.

 - there is also *unjailing* or *unlocking* the phone so that it can be used with any SIM card on any GSM network;
   and I'll talk about that in due time.

*DISCLAIMER*: this may very well brick your phone!  Read all the instructions here, and the links I provide.  If you're still
not discouraged, continue on :)

Before you proceed, I cannot stress the importance of following directions.

 - I used the excellent [Beginners Guide for Rooting your Android G1 to install Cupcake](http://androidandme.com/2009/05/guides/beginners-guide-for-rooting-your-android-g1-to-install-cupcake/)
   
   There are multiple write-ups like this one.
 
   - I initially started with [How-to- Root, Hack, and Flash your G1/Dream](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=442480)
     article posted on [XDA developers](http://forum.xda-developers.com/) forums.
     
     It was very accurate, but rather old.  It does not use the `root.apk` application from the marketplace, which does most of the
     work for you.
   
   - there is also [How To Root Your T-Mobile G1](http://www.droidproof.com/blog/how-to/how-to-root-your-t-mobile-g1/)
     at the [DroidProof](http://www.droidproof.com/) blog.  The write up has 
     a [YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS9l2XVG0iY) that maybe worth watching.
     It's based on the previous (old) method of rooting, but note that they forget to tell you start up `telnetd` first.

 - While I encourage you to follow the [Beginners Guide](http://androidandme.com/2009/05/guides/beginners-guide-for-rooting-your-android-g1-to-install-cupcake/)
   it basically basically it boils down to this:
   
   - downgrade to RC29
   - gain root (using `root.apk`)
   - upgrade radio to v1.5 from [HTC official site](http://www.htc.com/www/support/android/adp.html) 
     or [googlecode.com mirror](http://android-roms.googlecode.com/files/ota-radio-2_22_19_26I.zip)
   - install custom image

 - Getting this far is a PITA.  After this upgrading to any image is trivial, just copy it to `update.zip` on the flash card, boot holding
   the *home* key, and push the magic *Alt-L* + *Alt-S* combo.

 - Future updates, at least to JF builds, become even easier with [jfupdater](http://code.google.com/p/jfupdater/).
