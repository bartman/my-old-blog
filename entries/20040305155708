I've just finished coding up this blog script.

I wanted something that did not use a database backend, and most importantly could be added to from the command line.

The implementation is in PHP and I add entries using vim.

The <a href=http://www.php.net/manual/en/index.php>PHP Manual</a> came in very handy.
