A freind asked me how he could check the age of a file in his git repository.  I came up with this:

        % git ls-files | xargs -n1 -i{} git log -1 --pretty=format:"%ci {}" -- {}
        2007-04-11 11:39:31 -0400 .gitignore
        2008-10-18 10:52:27 -0400 Xdefaults
        ...

It walks through all the files tracked by git and prints the time stamp of the last commit that
modified that file.

Git rocks!
