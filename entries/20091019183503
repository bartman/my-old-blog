I returned from the [2009 annual ACM Reflections | Projections](http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2009/index.html) conference held at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu/).
I was asked to speak at the conference about Git.

I really enjoyed attending the conference, and not just because I learned how to play [Beer Pong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_pong) at the staff party.  The organizers
did a really good job of putting on a great event -- even if the line ups for food were a bit long, but it was free food for starving students, so what would you expect.
I got to meet awesome people like Bram Moolenaar, the author of Vim, Alexis Ohanian, of reddit fame, and Ryan North, the guy behind Dinosaur Comics.  I was also in awe 
of the facilities the CS people have at UIUC.

For ACM Reflections, I ended giving two talks: first one to introduce the topic of revision control, and second one to show people how to use Git.  Although the
second talk was called a "Workshop" it was basically a 2 hour lecture on Git, and I think it well really well.  People kept asking questions for another hour after,
and I received nice comments after the talk.  However, I was not overly happy about the first part, and found it a bit weak.  I think I'll stick to teaching
people about Git, rather than teaching them about revision control in general.

The first talk was recorded and will be available on [the reflections website](http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2009/videos.html) soon, so you can tell me if you agree :)

Anyway, I ended up redoing my [previous presentation](http://www.jukie.net/~bart/blog/ogre-git-screencast) using a slightly 
different format.  You can get all the [slidework](http://www.jukie.net/~bart/slides/git-reflections/).

... and in case you're wondering I lost at Beer Pong.
