It irks me when I am searching for a solution to a problem I have, get a 
few dozen hits on google, but all I get are people stating the same problem.
Here is my attempt at improving the scoring of solutions.

In gdb 6.0 there is a frequently seen problem where the debugger complains
about "<b>Error while mapping shared library sections</b>".  I was unable 
to find the real cause of this, but 
<a href=http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?postid=975227>
this link</a> stated that an upgrade to gdb 6.1 fixes the problem.  There is also a link to a 
<a href=https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=127274>related redhat bugzilla bug entry</a>.
