I now [have]{into-android} a [sim-unlocked]{sim-unlocking-g1} [rooted]{rooting-g1} T-mobile G1 phone running Android.  I've installed
the [Cyanogen v3.6.8.1 firmware](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=537204) on it, and upgraded the recovery image 
to [Cyanogen's pimped out version](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=3915123).

I am really impressed with the cell phone and MID aspects of the device.  But I bought it so I could do some hacking.

All right... so what else can I do with this thing?  It sounds logical that I now write a `Hello world` application.

Android apps are written in Java and run on a `davlik` virtual machine.  I am still learning, but from what I understand it's
a VM akin to the Java VM but more optimized for embedded devices and using completely incompatible bytecode.

After [installing the SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/1.5_r3/installing.html) you will have an emulator and 
some [development tools](http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/index.html) available in your `PATH`:

 - `android` - create and manage AVD (virtual devices) and projects
 - `apkbuilder` - build a package
 - `ddms` - a debugger for davlik VMs on emulated or real
 - `dmtracedump` - parser for trace files
 - `draw9patch` - tool for converting images into 9-region scalable ones
 - `emulator` - qemu based emulator
 - `hierarchyviewer` - interface design viewer tool
 - `hprof-conv` - *don't know yet*
 - `mksdcard` - create a disk image for the emulator
 - `sqlite3` - everyone ships their own sqlilte3 binary :)
 - `traceview` - log viewer for debugging apps

Before building on Debian, I needed to install the following additional tools:

    # apt-get install sun-java6-bin sun-java6-jdk ant ia32-libs

(the `ia32-libs` is only needed on 64 bit systems)

For whatever reason, I also had to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable like so:

    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.14/

(without it, it complained that it was set to `/usr/lib/jvm/ia32-java-6-sun-1.6.0.14/jre` ... note that I just had to remove the `jre` from what it self detected)

Along with the tools the SDK comes with some activities and tutorials under `platforms/android-1.5/samples/`, but
it's probably better to follow along with the online [on line versions](http://developer.android.com/guide/tutorials/hello-world.html).

I started by creating a new project:

    # android create project --target 1 --path ./test1 --activity Test1 --package net.jukie.test1
    # cd test1

I then made some changes to the `src/net/jukie/test1/Test1.java` app:

 - added `import android.widget.TextView;` at the top.
 - modified `onCreate()` to read:

        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        TextView tv = new TextView(this);
        tv.setText("Hello, Android");
        setContentView(tv);

And, now to build the sucker:

    # cd platforms/android-1.5/samples/HelloActivity
    # ant debug

That gives me a `bin/Test1-debug.apk`.

Next, I installed the app on my device using:

    # adb install bin/Test1-debug.apk
    87 KB/s (4468 bytes in 0.049s)
        pkg: /data/local/tmp/Test1-debug.apk
    Success

Weee!  My first useless app is now running on my Tmobile G1 displaying *Hello, Android*.

    What I learned here was that `and start-server` needs to run as root.
