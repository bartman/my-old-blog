After reading that [Lenovo will not install or support the Linux operating system](http://www.crn.com/sections/infrastructure/infrastructure.jhtml?articleId=188701277) 
on [Slashdot](http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/06/04/0415221&from=rss) I decided
that chances are good my next laptop will not be a black one.

I've been very happy with the IBM ThinkPad line... every thing just worked.  Not just for me, but I know many
Linux users that felt this same way.

I don't really need them to install Linux on it for me -- although doing so would mean not paying 
the [Windows TAX](http://www.google.com/linux?q=laptop+%22windows+tax%22).  Chances are that whatever *enterprisey* 
distro they install will not live on the laptop for long.  But I want them to test their hardware with Linux on 
it.  Which in the end means that they have to install Linux on it for themselves.

I wanted to let them know that I was displeased so I went to their [Contact Lenovo](http://www.lenovo.com/scripts/contact/contact3/us/en) feedback page and wrote this:

    I was saddened to hear that Lenovo is dropping support for Linux on
    their ThinkPad line of products.  I have purchased a ThinkPad for my
    last three laptops and have recommended them to countless individuals in
    the Linux community as well as outside.  I was comfortable purchasing
    and recommending ThinkPad products not just because they were a solid
    product but also because Linux always worked on them.

    I am a Linux consultant, I don't run Windows.  I am sad to say that when
    my X41 requires a replacement, I will have to look elsewhere for a
    laptop.

    Regards,
    Bart.

### update

So it turns out that [Lenovo really does care about Linux](http://news.com.com/Lenovo+denies+ditching+Linux/2100-1003_3-6080115.html?tag=nefd.top)
and the stories reported a few days back have been greatly exaggerated.

    Kardonski apparently confused Lenovo's stance on providing licenses for Linux, 
    as opposed to providing preloaded versions of the software for customers, Godin 
    said. Because different companies use different configurations of Linux on their 
    ThinkPad notebooks, Lenovo doesn't provide licenses for the software, he said. 
    Customers are responsible for acquiring the license on their own, but Lenovo 
    will preinstall the desired configuration on new ThinkPads once the license has 
    been obtained.

Seems to me that someone here has no idea what they are talking about... *what licenses?*
