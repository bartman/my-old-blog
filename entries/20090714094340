Subject: importing an old project into git

I have recently been asked to revive an [old project](http://www.jukie.net/~bart/elfpgp/).  Way back when
I used to use bk for tracking changes.  But today, I don't even have a working bk tree.

Moving the history to git is easiest done by taking the tarballs I've published and creating a commit per tarball.

Below is a simple script that will do just that.

To run it you'd do something like:

        mkdir my-repo
        cd my-repo
        git init
        ../import ../*.tar.gz

And here is the `import` script:

        #!/bin/zsh
        set -e

        commit=
        for tar in $@ ; do

                echo >&2
                echo >&2 "# Importing: $tar"
                [[ -f $tar ]] || exit 1
                
                base=$(basename $tar)
                date=$(stat --format="%y" $tar)
                
                git rm -qrf .
                tar xzf $tar
                git add .
                
                tree=$(git write-tree)
                commit=$(GIT_AUTHOR_DATE="$date" git commit-tree $tree ${commit:+-p} $commit <<<"import of $base")
                
                git reset --hard $commit
        done    

        echo >&2
        echo >&2 "# SUCCESS"
