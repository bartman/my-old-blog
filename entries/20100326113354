I visited the [WIND Mobile](http://windmobile.ca) store at Westgate Mall this morning and [signed up for WIND service](http://www.windmobile.ca/community/WIND-news/detail/happy-launch-day-ottawa/).
(I was the first geek there... yeay!) I am using my Nexus One and getting 3..4 bars for voice (out of 4), and decent data throughput.

If you are setting up your android phone for WIND here are the instructions:

 - power off, put in sim card (sales guy put it in backwards, tee hee)
 - go to *Settings* => *Wireless & Networks* => *Mobile Networks* => *Access Point Names*
   - press menu and *New APN*
   - enter the following fields
     - *Name:* wind
     - *APN:* internet.windmobile.ca
     - *MCC:* 302
     - *MNC:* 490
   - press menu and *Save*
 - under *Mobile Network Settings* go to *Network operators*
   - it should find *WIND Home* and *WIND Away*
   - select *WIND Home*

... you will receive an SMS message welcoming you to WIND, and you should be able to make calls within a minute.

### Data...

I didn't have data when I left the store, nor did I have it 6 hours later.  I called in, got a tech support
person right away.  She knew what was missing, did something, told me to power down the device, remove the battery,
and reconnect in 30 seconds.  After following those instructions I had 3G.

In my area (Nepean) I get 4.2 Mbits/s downlink and 440 kbits/s uplink.
