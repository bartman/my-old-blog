I visited the [WIND Mobile](http://windmobile.ca) store at Westgate Mall this morning and signed up for WIND service.
(I was the first geek there... yeay!) I am using my Nexus One and getting 4/4 bars for voice.  No data yet.  According
to another customer cell enthusiast, that may take a few hours to start working.

If you are setting up your android phone for WIND here are the instructions:

 - power off, put in sim card (sales guy put it in backwards, tee hee)
 - go to *Settings* => *Wireless & Networks* => *Mobile Networks* => *Access Point Names*
   - press menu and *New APN*
   - enter the following fields
     - *Name:* wind
     - *APN:* internet.windmobile.ca
     - *MCC:* 302
     - *MNC:* 490
   - press menu and *Save*
 - under *Mobile Network Settings* go to *Network operators*
   - it should find *WIND Home* and *WIND Away*
   - select *WIND Home*

... you will receive an SMS message welcoming you to WIND, and you should be able to make calls within a minute.
