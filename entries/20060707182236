Sharing your current [last.fm]{tag/lastfm} track on irc in realtime is very important.  :)  Here is a ion3 binding that will use `xclip` to 
copy the current track info into the X clipboard.

        defbindings("WScreen", {
                kpress("Mod4+grave", "ioncore.exec('echo player/currentlyPlaying | nc localhost 32213 | xclip -i')"),
        })

Put it in `~/.ion3/cfg_user.lua`.
