I am working on a large kernel module which had just come out of a large (and fruitful)
internal API refactoring exercise.  I now want to go through and cull the unused functions.

It turns out, all that is needed is the `readlef` utility (part of `binutils` package).

First, we need to grab a list of externally visible functions:

    readelf -s mymodule.ko | awk '/\<FUNC\>.*\<GLOBAL\>/ { print $8 }'

Next, for each symbol we will print out the users of that function:

    readelf -r mymodule.ko | grep '\<{}\>'

Putting it all together:

    readelf -s mymodule.ko | awk '/\<FUNC\>.*\<GLOBAL\>/ { print $8 }' \
    | xargs -i{} -n1 sh -c "echo -n '{} ' ; readelf -r mymodule.ko | grep '\<{}\>' | wc -l"
