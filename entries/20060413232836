Debiean-heads might find it interesting that [Joey Hess](http://kitenet.net/~joey) has produced a 
detailed [SecureApt](http://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt) article on how to use security features
of *apt-get*.

The particularly interesting bits are:

- details about the security levels put into packages
- examples of how *apt-key* aught to be used
- timeline that the debian pgp keys will adhere to
- problems to be avoided and symptoms you will see if you have 'em
- links to relevant documentation
