I am giving a *intro to git* tutorial for [oclug](http://oclug.on.ca/) tomorrow.

Here are the slides in [PDF format](/~bart/slides/intro-to-git/intro-to-git.pdf).  If 
you are one of the lucky ones and magic point works for you, you can also 
grab [the source tarball](/~bart/slides/intro-to-git/intro-to-git.tgz).
