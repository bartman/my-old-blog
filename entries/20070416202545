*First there was a Navigator, then there was an Explorer. Later it was time for a Konqueror. Now it's time for an Imperator, the VIMperator :)*

[VIMperator](http://vimperator.mozdev.net/index.html) is a mozilla/firefox plugin from *Martin Stubenschrott*.  It completely redefines the firefox
interface to mimic the beloved [VIM](http://vim.org) editor.

If you love vim, you are likely to love VIMperator.  If not... well, your loss.

After using it a bit I have a few requirements before it's perfect:

 - fixed / searching

   right now searching is a bit flaky, but I read that the developer is working on writing his own and not using firefox's built in search.
  
 - ^o for no-clobber mode 

   when you use VIMperator, gmail interface does not work -- or at least the shortcuts don't.  Having a way to enter a raw entry mode would be nice.
  
 - way to jump to next text entry box

   to avoid the mouse, it would be great if I could cycle through text entry boxes.
                   
 - launch vim on an entry box

   I already do this with the [It's all text](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125) extension.  But it requires a click.  Those suck.
