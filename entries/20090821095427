We were hanging out by the pool on my daughter's birthday.  I thought I would be an ever-so-funny-guy and
push my wife into the pool.  She thought she would be equally funny and pull me in with her.  So far so good,
all fun and games.

As soon as I landed in the water, and remembered that I had my [G1]{tag/g1} in my pocket, I instantly felt 100% less funny.

This story has a good ending, as I was able to get the phone back into perfectly working condition...

Below are the steps I took to dry my phone; below that are some links that I found on the net which were of use:

 - immediately take out the battery (resist the temptation to put it back for at least 24h)
 - take out the sim card and the memory card; dry those separately
 - rinse the phone out with fresh water (my pool has salt water, which is corrosive)
 - shake all the water out that you can
 - open any compartments, and slide out the keyboard
 - blow in all the holes to get as much of the water out
 - direct a fan on the phone (for an hour) to force air to pick up more moisture; flip it a few times as it sits there
 - while the phone blow dries, prepare a sealable container with uncooked white rice
 - loosely wrap the phone in a tissue and stick it into the container with uncooked rice and seal it (the tissue keeps the rice dust from the phone openings)
 - leave it there for as long as you want; the rice will pull moisture out of the phone
 - (optional) say a prayer, sacrifice a goat, etc
 - put the sim/sd-card/battery back in the phone and test all the components
 - rejoice or mourn

When I got to the end of this procedure I still saw some *water bubbles* under the glass cover on the LCD.  I intended to open up the screen
to see if I could dry it out, but didn't since the phone was still usable.  Over the last couple of days they've been vanishing and now the phone is as good as new.
