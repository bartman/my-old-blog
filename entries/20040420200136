<p>I got frustrated with Open Office today.  I was going to write a document and peeked for the first time into the templates that open office came with.  Well, was I disappointed to find a whole 2 templates. :)</p>

<p>But it turns out that my third google search found the answer; a few of them at that...
<ul>
<li><a href=http://www.getopenoffice.org/templates.html>GetOpenOffice.org</a> - OpenOffice.org Templates
<li><a href=http://ooextras.sourceforge.net/>OO Extras</a> - Extras for OpenOffice.org
<li><a href=http://www.ooodocs.org/>OOo Docs</a> - The OpenOffice Documentation Project
</ul>
</p>

<p>So after searching through some nice templates I downloaded the one I wanted to use.</p>

<p>All is well again.</p>
