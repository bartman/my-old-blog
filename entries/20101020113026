I have an LVM volume, with xfs on it, that is almost full:

    $ df /scratch -h
    Filesystem                Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/mapper/vg-scratch    180G  175G  5.4G  98% /scratch

    $ sudo lvdisplay /dev/mapper/vg-scratch
    ...
      LV Size                180.00 GB
    ...

But I have some more space in the physical volume.  Let's grow the logical volume.

First, let's grow the volume by 20G...

    $ sudo lvresize -L +20G /dev/mapper/vg-scratch
      Extending logical volume scratch to 200.00 GB
      Logical volume scratch successfully resized

    $ sudo lvdisplay /dev/mapper/vg-scratch
    ...
      LV Size                200.00 GB
    ...

Next, let's tell the XFS file system to fill in the space...

    $ sudo xfs_growfs /scratch
    ...
    data blocks changed from 47185920 to 52428800

    $ df /scratch -h
    Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/mapper/vg-scratch
                          200G  175G   26G  88% /scratch
