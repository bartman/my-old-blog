Over the last [few]{20060802210126} [days]{20060803233234}, I have been experiencing odd crashes.  I have been able to
narrow it down to network activity.  Most of the time this has been triggered with NFS access; I assume that 
it has something to do with large UDP fragments; my MTU is 1500.

The last couple of days I have had a serial console connected to the machine, and my laptop standing by waiting for 
another crash.  It occurred, but something really bad happened because on the console I only got:

    [   65.597418] [drm] writeback test succeeded in 1 usecs
    [  835.777136]
    [  835.777138] HARDWARE ER  

... and then the system was completely locked up.  I really wish I knew what that HARDWARE ERROR was :(

I guess this sounds familiar.  On day one, I was looking for answers and found [a windows user having the same 
problems](http://forums.amd.com/index.php?showtopic=80512).  I have ordered an e1000 NIC.

I put an old 3COM NIC into a PCI slot and have been using that.
