I must have recently upgraded to a new screen.  My screenrc file was using the `chdir` directive
so that the windows started inside would have a PWD I wanted them to.  As soon as I tried
to reconnect the screen session would die.

        screen -x
        Unable to open "screenrc"

I was able to find the [bug on savannah](http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?18890) that described
the symptom quite well.

I then wrote a [wrapper zsh function](http://www.jukie.net/~bart/conf/zsh.d/S51_screen) which fixes
the problem:

        REAL_SCREEN=$(which screen)

        # convert the path passed via the -c parameter to an absolute one
        screen() {
                local max=$((${#argv}-1))
                for (( x=1 ; x<=$max ; x++ )) ; do
                        local flag="${argv[$x]}"
                        if [[ "x$flag" = "x-c" ]] ; then
                                local y=$(($x+1))
                                local word="${argv[$y]}"
                                if [[ "x${word[1]}" != 'x/' ]] ; then
                                        argv[$y]="$PWD/$word"
                                fi
                        fi
                done

                echo ${REAL_SCREEN} ${1+"$argv"}
                ${REAL_SCREEN} ${1+"$@"}
        }
